        <h2>How we started?</h2>
        <p>Our journey began with 3 friends who had a passion for mathematics and a shared vision to make a difference
            in students' lives.
            Recognizing the challenges many students face in grasping mathematical concepts, we decided to establish our
            own math tutoring business. With a firm belief in personalized learning and individual attention, we
            designed a comprehensive curriculum tailored to meet the unique needs of each student.
