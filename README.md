## **Design**

 ![Logo](assets\img\logo.png)
### Colour Scheme  
 ![Palette](assets/img/readme/palette.png)

The colour scheme used is based on the logo that was generated. This led to the main two colors being an off-white (#E9E9E7) and brown (#5d5250). The brighter colours in the logo are incorporated throughout the website in  small snippets.

### Font
Following the logo, the font to the website uses the main font for all the headings and a lighter font as the general text. The font is a softer font without sharp edges to be more appealing to a young audience and to not come across too harsh.

### Imagery 
The website was to follow a similar theme of the Code Institute sample website 'Love Running'. However the plan was to have an informative and easy to navigate website. The inital plan was to have multiple pages, however after some thought to make a more user friendly website I believed that a single page is easier to navigate.

### Code
[MathsHub](https://github.com/hhw1101/MathsHub) is based on my own implementation of code, using what I had learned in the [Code Institute Web Developer Course](https://codeinstitute.net/).

Inspiration was taken from [Code Institute Love Running](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/love-running-2.0)
